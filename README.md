# Medical history predicts phenome-wide disease onset
Here we present the downstream analysis for the paper "Medical history predicts phenome-wide disease onset". Detailed instructions on the data preprocessing, model training and inference can be found [here](https://github.com/nebw/medhist).

1. Steps to prepare the data can be found in 1_data_preparation.
2. The downstream processing to aggregate predictions and evaluate the models can be found in 2_downstream_processing
3. Visualisations and Tables are generated in 3_figures_and_tables
